    <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold">Stay awake and alert at all times</h1>
    <p class="col-md-12 fs-4">You may be tempted to read a book, check your messages, or take a quick nap on public transportation, but that’s the perfect way to have your wallet, camera, backpack and other stuff stolen. Plus, you could end up in a strange place at the end of the bus line with no way to get back if you sleep too long!
    <br></br><br></br>Stay awake and alert no matter how tired you are. This is true when you’re in a taxi as well – your driver could be just as dangerous as a common criminal.</p>

      <h2>Keep close control over your bags and packages</h2>
      <p>Just like at the airport, it’s essential to keep close control over your bags and packages if you are to keep them in your possession. This is especially important if you have several bags or packages, or if everyone on the bus or train has similar bags. It’s easy for a thief to switch out an empty one that looks just like yours when all the bags come from the same retailer.
      <br></br><br></br>Bunch your bags between your feet or close on the seat beside you when you’re sitting, and keep hold of them when you’re standing.</p>

      <h2>Get off the bus if it gets too crowded</h2>
      <p>When people are pressing in all around you, it’s harder for you to watch and protect your  belongings. Crowds are not a traveler’s friend – in fact, they can make it far easier for pickpockets and thieves to do their dirty work and escape quickly.
        <br></br><br></br>If things are getting too crowded, get off the bus at the next well-lit stop and wait for a less crowded one.</p>
